# Eco Gnome Mod

## Project is currently in beta

This repository contains the Data Extractor part of [Eco Gnome](https://eco-gnome.com).   
It allows to extract your specific server configuration (skills, recipes, items, ...) to visualize and calculate their price in [Eco Gnome](https://eco-gnome.com) website.  
Extracted file will be created in your server file root folder: `eco_gnome_data.json`

It allows to synchronize prices between your shops and EcoGnome website thanks to three commands:
- /EcoGnome registerserver **{JoinCode}**   :   To be launched by admin during the setup of the server
- /EcoGnome registeruser **{SecretId}**     :   To be launched by all users only one time
- /EcoGnome syncshop                    :   Apply your EcoGnome prices on your targeted shop. It doesn't add or remove items, only edit prices of matching items.
